### interaction
* mobile phone interface is used for number input
* numbers can be put in manually or saved into a list
* dialing takes some seconds with audio feedback
* transmission begins with keypress "TRANSMIT"-button, ends on second press
* if target is already in a transmission, no connection can be established and OCCUPIED-sound signal is played
